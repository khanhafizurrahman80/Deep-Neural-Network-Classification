# Deep Neural Netwrok for Logistic Regression from Scratch

A complete cycle of deep learning method is developed without involvement of any framework. The project is done for the learning purpose while doing the course: https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning?utm_source=gg&utm_medium=sem&campaignid=904733485&adgroupid=45435009512&device=c&keyword=deep%20learning%20coursera&matchtype=b&network=g&devicemodel=&adpostion=1t1&creativeid=231631799243&hide_mobile_promo&gclid=Cj0KCQjwof3cBRD9ARIsAP8x70OHyWzKtRqbAogZFpl75-Xo2ONMrb8QQFQboCCfJFK3_yH9oATjGuUaAnJREALw_wcB. Many of the idea is taken from their assignments.

Prerequisite:
* Python 2.7 or Python 3.6
* numpy
* scikit-learn(for dataset)

There are total 7 numbers of file are present. Each name of the file is self explanatory about describing the purpose of each module.
