# Deep Neural Netwrok for Logistic Regression from Scratch

A complete cycle of deep learning method is developed without involvement of any framework. The project is done for the learning purpose while doing the course: https://www.coursera.org/learn/neural-networks-deep-learning. Many of the idea is taken from their assignments.

Prerequisite:
* Python 2.7 or Python 3.6
* numpy
* scikit-learn(for dataset)

There are total 7 numbers of file are present. Each name of the file is self explanatory about describing the purpose of each module.
